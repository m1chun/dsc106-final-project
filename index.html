        <h2>Checkpoint - Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>CalFire and California Department of Fish and Wildlife Data:</h3>
        <p>We like the idea of modeling fires like we did in Project 3, 
            but wanted to work with different data that was more relevant to us here in California. 
            The Cal-Fire data is full of excellent data sets. Not only is the data already in an interactive format when you access it, 
            making understanding everything much easier, but also all their data sets are easily accessible and come in various different formats. 
            It's really very useful to be able to make a map with geojson files while also working with the specific data in the form of a csv. 
            We think the data available at Cal-Fire will let us create a visualization that is more focused than our Project 3 and lets 
            us convey more interesting information.</p>
        <h3>What we intend to do:</h3>
        <p>Our big idea is we want to model what kinds of ecosystems in California are more fire resistant than others. 
            There's kind of two halves to that: 
            The first is to look at which areas are more fire prone than others. 
            This should be the easier part since Cal-Fire already has data on fire risk. 
            We can also determine which areas are more fire prone than others by just counting the number of fires in a designated seed zone and 
            standardizing by dividing by the area of the seed zone.
            The second part to this is measuring how severely fires affected a given ecosystem type. 
            We like CalFire's California Vegetation Burn Severity Data Viewer which does a great job displaying that info but it's been really tricky 
            to actually work with that data to create a different visualization. 
            We may end up giving up on this idea if we can't figure it out or find a different, similar data set.
            In the end all of this stuff could end up being too complicated (or the bigger problem, 
            our GeoJSON data is just too big to handle using simple D3 techniques), and we may shift our stance. 
            It may be better to model fire risk associated with different ecosystem types in California and to 
            then create a general map of fire risk depending on what ecosystem is where.

      <h2>California Seed Zones</h2>

      <p>
        This layer maps the California tree seed zones originally published by the U.S. Forest Service and CAL FIRE.
        The 85 seed zones are defined by climatic, topographic, and soil conditions that determine plant adaptability.
        Zones are labeled using a three-digit system where each digit represents region, subregion, and subzone.
        These boundaries follow natural or physical features when possible.
