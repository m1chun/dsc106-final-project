        <h2>Checkpoint - Project Overview</h2>
        <h3>CalFire and California Department of Fish and Wildlife Data:</h3>
        <p>We like the idea of modeling fires like we did in Project 3, 
            but wanted to work with different data that was more relevant to us here in California. 
            The Cal-Fire data is full of excellent data sets. Not only is the data already in an interactive format when you access it, 
            making understanding everything much easier, but also all their data sets are easily accessible and come in various different formats. 
            It's really very useful to be able to make a map with geojson files while also working with the specific data in the form of a csv. 
            We think the data available at Cal-Fire will let us create a visualization that is more focused than our Project 3 and lets 
            us convey more interesting information.</p>
        <h3>What we intend to do:</h3>
        <p>Our big idea is we want to model what kinds of ecosystems in California are more fire resistant than others. 
            There's kind of two halves to that: 
            The first is to look at which areas are more fire prone than others. 
            This should be the easier part since Cal-Fire already has data on fire risk. 
            We can also determine which areas are more fire prone than others by just counting the number of fires in a designated seed zone and 
            standardizing by dividing by the area of the seed zone.
            The second part to this is measuring how severely fires affected a given ecosystem type. 
            We like CalFire's California Vegetation Burn Severity Data Viewer which does a great job displaying that info but it's been really tricky 
            to actually work with that data to create a different visualization. 
            We may end up giving up on this idea if we can't figure it out or find a different, similar data set.
            In the end all of this stuff could end up being too complicated (or the bigger problem, 
            our GeoJSON data is just too big to handle using simple D3 techniques), and we may shift our stance. 
            It may be better to model fire risk associated with different ecosystem types in California and to 
            then create a general map of fire risk depending on what ecosystem is where.

      <p>
        This layer maps the California tree seed zones originally published by the U.S. Forest Service and CAL FIRE.
        The 85 seed zones are defined by climatic, topographic, and soil conditions that determine plant adaptability.
        Zones are labeled using a three-digit system where each digit represents region, subregion, and subzone.
        These boundaries follow natural or physical features when possible.

      <h3>1. What have you done so far?</h3>
      <p>So far we have creates some basic plots and visualizations of California to get a sense of what our final project could look like.
        We are most proud of our last visualization of the fire density per seed zone and we might make this our starting visualization that viewers can click on
        to go into specific details of each seed zone. We also included a visualization about rare vegetation to see if we could see a pattern between 
        wildfires and those areas in California. Our charts of fires in California provide good background information for the viewers so we can inform them on why 
        this topic is so important for combatting climate change.
      </p>

      <h3>2. What will be the most challenging part of your project to design and why?</h3>
      <p>Incorporating the animation and making the map transitions smooth through clicks and hovers will be the most challenging part.
        We have an overall sense of what we want to project to look like, but turning it into D3 and JS code is a little tricky. We have a pretty good understanting on
        how to create visualizations, but we want to user's side of the website to be easy to use and look aesthetically pleasing as they scroll through
        the project. We hope that with the skills we learned in project 3, lab 8, and the recent lectures, we will have a general foundation for the website.
